h-chu
=====

A multiplayer text-based Haskell implementation of the card game [Tichu](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tichu "Wikipedia page.").

The executable takes one integer argument specifying which port to use. If no argument is given port 4444 is used by default.

The four players should then connect to the server using any telnet client of their choice on the given port; within the game help text can be accessed using 'help' or '?'.
